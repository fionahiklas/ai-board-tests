# AI Board Tests


## Overview

Trying out various AI/ML boards

## Infrastructure

### Network

I have multiple subnets in my home network.  For the sake of testing the AI boards I'm going to 
have everything connected to a dedicated VLAN/subnet.  I'm using the `192.168.33.0/24` subnet on
VLAN 33 with the default router/DNS at `192.168.33.254` and a DHCP range from `.100` to `.200`.
